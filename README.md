## ISLR-Python
Implementation of Labs and Exercises from An Introduction to Statistical
Learning 2nd Edition in Python

## Used Packages
    * Scikit-Learn --> for most Estimators
    * Statsmodels --> for certain Tests/Statistics in the Regression/Multiple Testing chapters
    * Tensorflow/Keras --> for the deep learning chapter
    * numpy --> linear algebra
    * pandas --> dataframe & data fetching
    * matplotlib / seaborn --> plotting

## Data Sources 
Because there is no equivalent python package to R's ISLR2 which contains the necessary datasets 
for the labs/exercises we will use pandas read_csv function to retrieve the datasets from the 
[Rdatasets](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/Rdatasets/tree/master/csv/ISLR "Rdatasets") repo
